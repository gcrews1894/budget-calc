# budget-calc

This challenge was very fun. I utilized create-react-app for the sake of time, but I usually prefer to build the environment from scratch.

I did my best to utilize typeScript, but I was encountering some errors here. This is one of the biggest areas I would refactor if given more time.

I decided to come as close to the Yardzen aesthetic as possible, so I examined the website and grabbed as many of the colors and fonts used as I could.
